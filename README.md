# ETL-milestone
> This project is based engineering data and it is required as fundamental step in "Henry" data science academy.

> During the previously mentioned project, I have implemented several data science concepts regarding cleansing and consulting technics I learnd during the Henry's bootcamp.

> The target is to apply the three-phases in a ETL process. The primitive data set were provided for Henry academy in different type of files. (.xlsx, .txt, .parquet, .csv)

> The ETL path that I followed was initially download the raw documents into my locall machine, then by using a visualization platform (VSCode) I uploaded the documents for starting the visual analysis and recognition stage, identifying regist nulls -NaN -outliers -usefull columns and so on. 

> By using Python programming language and their  some of their libraries (pandas, numpy) implemented cleasing technics such as drop null values, implementing methdos and built-in functions like stri(), slice(), apply() I transformed the data set upto converting it in a .csv file to finally loaded in a database visualization and manipulation programm like MySql where after checking the new datasets conditions final product (DATABASE) were created in shape and quality.
